# Contribution Guidelines

## Fundamentals of Contribution

- This repository is maintained and managed by the community.
- The aim is to disclose the most common to the most complex algorithms that can be implemented in Pawn.
- If you have a unique algorithm, share it by following the guidelines in this file.
- Simple and adapted algorithms for Pawn are also welcome, as long as their origin/author is specified in the file and if its license permits.
- If you have an algorithm developed by someone, please credit it.
- If you share, your work will be distributed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/iPollo/PawnAlgorithms/blob/main/LICENSE) once it is integrated into the main project.

## File Structures

- Each file will contain the titles "Original Post By" and "Maintainers", everyone who helps to improve the file itself will be marked in it.
- Clearly, you should always seek to use good code practices. But don't worry, if you have an algorithm and want to share, follow this guide and go ahead. Over time the architecture of the codes will be improved, with this, you will be able to follow the changes and study these new structures in detail, understanding how to apply good practices and why to apply them.
- Any help is welcome to maintain a good repository, from a spell check to a new implementation for an algorithm.

## Corrections

- If you found an error in a file and want to open an "issue" make sure that there is no an open one explaining this same problem.
- If you cannot find an open issue, you can open one, pay attention to describe what you found.
- If you think you can solve the problem, open the issue and send a Pull Request marking the issue, then the file will be evaluated.
- Although we check if the code compiles and does what it promises, make sure it is compiling before opening a Pull Request, speeding up the whole process.

## Implementations

- If you want to contribute by adding new files, descriptions, algorithms or whatever, just open a Pull Request, pay attention to describe in detail in the Title and Description the features and objectives.
- If what you want to implement, structurally speaking, is an addition with many details and project ramifications, open an issue and discuss with the community before proceeding to a pull request.
- When submitting a new algorithm, be sure to add examples and test cases and indicate it as an option for its implementation.
- Make sure to put your new file in the correct directory, if it doesn't fit in any, create one for it with a short and simple name that explains what the folder is about, following the Directory guidelines below
- Directory guidelines: Avoid creating new directories as much as possible, but if it is "impossible" follow:
- - Do not use spaces or "-" between words, use only "\_" (e.g: Math_geometric)
- - The initial letter must be uppercase, the others, lower case.

## Ethical Maintenance Protocol

When you contribute, be aware of this protocol:

- Be kind and respectful when talking and debating with other members and contributors.
- For issues and Pull Requests make useful and detailed suggestions and comments aware that nobody knows everything.
- Be sure not to make invalid suggestions/comments, but if you do it by mistake, don't worry, we're here to learn.
- If you want to review or make suggestions, guide the author of the Pull Request, helping him to finalize it.
