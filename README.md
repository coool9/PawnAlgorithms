# Pawn Algorithms

## Introduction

The repository is a collection of open-source implementation of a variety of algorithms implemented in PAWN and licensed under [MIT License](https://github.com/iPollo/PawnAlgorithms/blob/main/LICENSE). This repository aims to share several algorithms implemented in Pawn for educational and professional purposes, the codes contain descriptions that aim to be detailed to exemplify the functionality of the algorithm.

## Fundamentals

- This repository aims to reach the largest number of people, thus seeking to improve the base code described here.
- The codes described here are compiled and tested. Its functionality and structure MUST be improved over time.
- Don't be ashamed, see the Contribution File and share algorithms for the base of this repository.

## Contributions

- This file is maintained and managed by the community.
- The aim is to disclose the most common to the most complex algorithms that can be implemented in Pawn.
- If you have a unique algorithm, share it by creating a Pull Request.
- Simple and adapted algorithms for Pawn are also welcome, as long as their origin is specified in the file.
- If you have an algorithm developed by someone, please credit it.
- For more INFO, see: [Contribution]().
